When helping me with my MERN stack project, please:

1. Check if all imported files exist before suggesting code changes
2. When creating new components that depend on other files, create ALL required dependencies
3. Verify that the import paths match my project structure
4. If you're unsure about a file's existence, ask me first or provide the complete implementation
5. When suggesting UI components, include all necessary utility functions and dependencies
6. For state management stores, provide the complete implementation
7. Include package.json updates if new npm packages are needed

Also make sure:
1. The UI is beautiful and follows the theme.
2. The form validations are added
3. The end to end API is connected and proper error handling is there.
4. Check if all imported files exist before suggesting code changes

My project uses:
- TypeScript with strict mode
- React with shadcn/ui components
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite as the build tool
